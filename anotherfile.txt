To print all tables inside a PostgreSQL database, you can use the following SQL query:

sql

SELECT table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' AND table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');

This query will return all the tables in the database, excluding system tables.

If you're using the psql command-line tool, you can also list all tables using:

bash

\dt

Make sure you're connected to the correct database before running the commands. To connect, use:

bash

\c your_database_name;
